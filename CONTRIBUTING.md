## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO AXEL DEVELOPMENT

Packit is available at https://github.com/eribertomota/packit

If you are interested in contribute to Packit development, please, follow
these steps:

1. Send me a patch that fix an issue or that implement a new feature.
   Alternatively, you can do a 'pull request'[1] in GitHub. Other good
   idea is help to remove the building warnings.

2. Ask for join to the Packit project in GitHub, if you want to work
   officially. Note that this second step is not compulsory. However,
   to accept you in project, I need a minimum collaboration before.

**TIP: now, Packit needs to understand IPv6. Can you implement it?**
